        task: "My tasks included collecting cells' kinematic data from bright field videos from experiments in deterministic lateral displacement devices, collecting locations and cell image crops at different time frames and registration, post-processing to get the motion types, knematic displacement and tilt, building up training datasets and machine learning wth design table, conducting data analysis from the model, and active learning experiments with incremental data samples. Focused on the development of images containing particles and improving object detection algorithm for biomedical/clinical application to identify various cells based on their cytometry. My main role was to develop an inspection algorithm to verify the integrity of the particles detected thruogh the object detection algorithm. Created a GUI for user-interaction to focus on certain particles for further analysis. Plot features, such as the trajectory, sizeband, and highlight pillars, are displayed to verify data collected.
