                    <p>Welcome to my website! I'm thrilled to have you here and share a bit about myself. I am a
                        passionate Computer Engineer with a deep interest in software engineering, data
                        analysis, and systems engineering. Through my journey, I have gained
                        valuable experience and expertise in software engineering through undergraduate research,
                        coursework, and personal projects.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to continuously learn and to become a software engineer. I believe in continuous
                        improvements, integrity, collaboration, and discipline in order to succeed and strive to share
                        learning and insights with others through mentorship, presentations, or knowledge sharing
                        platforms, uphold promises and commitments, foster a collaborative and inclusive work
                        environment
                        by actively listening to others, valuing their perspectives, and promoting open communication,
                        and demonstrate strong work ethics and self-discipline by setting clear goals, prioritizing
                        tasks, and meeting deadlines consistently. With a strong commitment to excellence and a
                        passion for software engineering, I am dedicated to secure a software engineering position that
                        provides me with challenging projects and opportunities for growth. I aim to work in a dynamic
                        and innovative environment where I can apply my technical skills and contribute to the
                        development of cutting-edge software solutions.

                    <p>
                        Throughout my undergraduate experience, I have had the privilege of assisting in undergraduate
                        research projects in the department of electrical and computer engineering, the department of
                        bioengineering, and software engineering coursework. These experiences have shaped my skills in
                        machine learning, project management, mobile and web development, backend development, and
                        provided me with insights into software engineering.

                    <p>
                        When I'm not working or pursuing my professional goals, you can find me immersing myself in
                        learning new skills through free online resources like the Odin Project and w3schools, hitting
                        the gym to stay active and healthy, and challenging my mind with word search puzzles. It's my
                        way of embracing continuous growth, both mentally and physically.
